## Intro ##

Note: This tag plugin is very early in its development, and basically only takes a latitud and longitude as arguments.


{% google-maps latitude longitude  %}


You can put as many as you'd like on a page.

## Example


{% google-maps 35.21792 -97.50329  %}

{% google-maps 71.29056 -156.78861  %}

will produce two maps for Oklahoma City and Barrow, Alaska
